# spaghetti.js
Heavily inspired by patron.js: https://github.com/LJNeon/patron.js/tree/master/src/structures.

TODO:
- Most of the shit from patron.js
- Some shit from discord.js
- Easier more user-friendly usage of Matrix API, hide the ooogly stuff
- HEAVY VALIDATION. Everything you can validate at bot start, DO IT!
